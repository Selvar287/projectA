           <p class="words" > Abhyudaya, came into being in 2004 as a project under Keshava Kripa Samvardhana Samiti (KKSS) as a Non-Profit Organization (NGO). Starting out as a free tuition center with 12 students, currently Abhyudaya reaches out to more than 3,600 students, spread across remote villages and slum clusters of Bangalore through life skills, value based education and healthcare related activities. Socially deprived children, their families and the neighbourhood become the focus group of Abhyudaya activities as education has to be imparted holistically. 
            We believe, it is our solemn duty to educate children for the benefit of the society and country at large.
